# Retro_Game_Jam-SNES-Bloons

## About

This is a SNES game we made for the Retro Game Jam 2021, which can be found at
this link: https://itch.io/jam/retro-jam-2021

Our game is based on the original Bloons flash game, except ported to the SNES.

## Building

To build, simply navigate to the root directory of the project in a command line
and either:

### 1) If on Windows

- Make sure you have mingw32-make downloaded and added to your path
- Type "mingw32-make" into the command line

### 2) If on an unix-like OS (e.g. Linux)

- Type "make" into the command line

## Running

Building will generate an executable that can be ran in a SNES emulator. You can simply
load the executable into your emulator to run it.

Our recommended emulator is bsnes+.
